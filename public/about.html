<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Currently I am a first grade teacher. I love what I do, but am looking for another passion to turn into my next career.
  The more that is pushed onto teachers, the more the joy of my classroom teaching is being outweighed.
  So, I decided to learn coding to work towards becoming a web developer! I am going to start documenting my learning journey -
  because of course a teacher would love to do that! 
</p>

<p>A free learn to code course gave me some terminology and background information to start with. Then I started a web development course.
  That's how I got here. I will be documenting the rest of my journey by updating this website and creating more as I learn.
</p>

<p>Hopefully you're here because you... 
  <ul>
    <li>support my learning</li>
    <li>are a novice web developer like me and want to connect!</li>
    <li>or maybe you're looking to see where I started from.</li>
  </ul>   
  Either way, I'm glad you've checked it out!
